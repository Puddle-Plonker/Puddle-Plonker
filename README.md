## About Me
My name is Hannah, I am a student at the University of Kent. I am currently working towards my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity. I am like to think I am pretty good with computers, but I know I still have much to learn. 

## My Favorite Websites
* *[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/)*  
  I use Spotify a lot during my day-to-day activities. I often listen to the mixes that Spotify creates instead of the playlists that I have created because I enjoy discovering new artists. Additionally, I like to listen to podcasts form time to time, especially if I am driving for long periods of time.
  
* *[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)*  
  In addition to Spotify, I use YouTube a lot as well. Typically, I put a YouTube video on in the background while I work, particularly if what I am working on does not take much brainpower, such as doing the dishes or cleaning.
  
* *[Volunteer Match](https://www.volunteermatch.org/)*  
  I enjoy volunteering, and Volunteer Match is a website that allows me to view volunteer opportunities in my community. In 2022 I accrued 137 volunteer hours through my school. In 2023, I had volunteered for 117 hours, also through my school. I find great satisfaction in serving my community, and this website makes it easier for me to do so.
